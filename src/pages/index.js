            The Union was established on 15th April 2018 with the vision to work
            with various stakeholders of the society, to aggregate resources to
            solve social problems from the root, while also creating an impact.
            Having been in the social sector for a while, we noticed that people
            not coming together to help society was a huge problem. Our vision
            is to build a youth community that works together for a better
            tomorrow
          </p>
          <p className="text-center lg:text-left">
            In simpler terms, we are a social aggregator which thrives on the
            asset of the youth community that we create. The union aims to unite
            people in society to work together for a better tomorrow. We are
            nothing without YOU!{" "}

            We kick-started our journey with a slum rehabilitation program,
            during which our volunteers did a complete need analysis and helped
            implement the best solutions for them.Â As part of the on-going
            battle against Covid-19, we have set up a dedicated helpline to
            provide help to those in need. Our volunteers go out of their way to
            provide help in any way they can.{" "}
